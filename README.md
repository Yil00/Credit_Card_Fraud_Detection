# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
Credit Card Frauds are the cases of using someone else's credit cards for financial transactions without the information of the card owner.

Credit Cards were made available inorder for the people to increase their buying power, it is an agreement with your bank that lets the user use the money lended by the bank in exchange for the repayment of this lended money on the due date or incur interest charges. With the rise in the e-commerce and the recent boom of OTT platforms during the Coronavirus Pandemic, use of credit cards has risen exponentially along with other payment processes. As all the things in the nature are binary, cases of credit card frauds has also achieved high numbers. Global economy pays the price of more than $ 24 billion per year due to these frauds. Thus, it becomes essential to solve this problem and as a result a lot of startups have been born into this \$ 30 billion industry.
Thus, building automated models for such a rising problem statement is necessary and AI - ML is the key for it!

## Context : 

It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

### Content
The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.
This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data. Features V1, V2, … V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-sensitive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.
